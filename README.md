- React Router: A library for declarative routing in React applications.
- Redux Toolkit: A library for state management in React applications.
- react-redux: Official React bindings for Redux, used to connect React components with the Redux store.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the application.

## Hooks Used

- useState: A React hook used for managing local component state.
- useEffect: A React hook used for performing side effects, such as data fetching and subscribing to state changes.
